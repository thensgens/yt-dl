TODO yt-dl:

- pyinstaller -> bundle ffmpeg and youtube-dl and export the application as a single binary (alternatively, add all required files to a bundle)
- check for files with '*.flv.part and re-download them manually if they haven't been downloaded already (and delete the parts)
- fully support cross-platform
